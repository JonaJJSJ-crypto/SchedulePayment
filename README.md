# SchedulePayment

Schedule Payment is a program write in 'Python3' that calculates how much a worker should get pay based on the day of the week and the time of the day that he/she had work on.

## Usage

- First, in your working directory, clone the github repository to obtain the program, by typing git clone in the console:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JonaJJSJ-crypto/SchedulePayment.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the compressed .zip file form the repository and extract it in your working directory.

- If done properly you could access the to program main directory by typing:
```bash
cd SchedulePayment/
```
* Here you can find:
  * README.md, contains user instructions
  * Schedule.txt, contains the worker name and work hours. Feel free to edit this file.
  * Schedule_backup.txt, Template how to write your Schedule.txt. Do not edit this file
  * Schedule_Payment.py, The program itself
 
- Next, you need to write a file named "Schedule.txt", containing the name of the worker and the work hours. For the program to work properly the entries of the file should have the following format: __The name__ followed by an equal symbol __'='__, the abbreviation of the day of the week that corresponds __"MO,TU,WE,TH,FR,SA,SU"__, the time work starts in 24h format __hh:mm__, followed by and minus symbol __'-'__, and the time work ends in 24h format __hh:mm__:
```
RENE=MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00
```
You can use the Schedule.txt a an starting point, feel free to edit this file. There is another template named Schedule_backup.txt, you could copy this template to Schedule.txt whenever you want, but you should never edit this file. Finally, make sure your Schedule.txt file is allocated in the same Schedule directory along with the program itself.

- If all the previous steps where done properly you should be ready to run the program. Start the program by typing in the console: 
```bash
python3 Schedule_Payment.py
```
The output of this program should look something like this:
```bash
RENE
MO   10:00-12:00     Pay for the Schedule: 30.0
TU   10:00-12:00     Pay for the Schedule: 30.0
TH   01:00-03:00     Pay for the Schedule: 50.0
SA   14:00-18:00     Pay for the Schedule: 80.0
SU   20:00-21:00     Pay for the Schedule: 25.0
The amount to pay RENE is: 215.0 USD.

The amount to pay ASTRID is: 85.0 USD.
```
